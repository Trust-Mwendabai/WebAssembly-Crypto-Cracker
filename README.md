Key Features:
1. Simulated WebAssembly

Appears to use WebAssembly but actually uses complex JavaScript
Custom encryption algorithm with bit rotation and multiple XOR operations
Delayed initialization to simulate WASM loading

2. DOM-Based Key Derivation

Hidden elements with specific positions and RGB colors
Key combines:

Element positions (getBoundingClientRect)
RGB color values extracted from computed styles
XOR operations between positions and colors
Canvas fingerprinting for additional entropy
Timestamp (reduced precision)



3. Anti-Debugging Measures

DevTools detection
Console clearing when DevTools are opened
Hidden debug traps

4. Solution Path
Players must:

Reverse engineer the key derivation algorithm
Analyze the DOM elements (positions: 42px, 137px, etc. and RGB values)
Understand the custom encryption algorithm
Discover the easter egg: use website="ctf" and username="admin"
Extract the flag from the encrypted constant

Difficulty Elements:

Complex key derivation from DOM properties
Custom crypto algorithm requiring reversal
Multiple layers of obfuscation
Anti-debugging features
Hidden encrypted flag constant

The challenge looks like a simple password manager but requires deep reverse engineering skills to extract the hidden flag!
